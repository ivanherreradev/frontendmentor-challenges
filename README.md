# 🚀 Frontend Mentor challenges solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for **Frontend Mentor** challenges. Here you will find implementations of different frontend challenges that help improve my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React skills.

## 📌 Description

Each of the challenges is organized in its own folder. The challenges range from basic projects with just HTML and CSS to interactive applications with JavaScript and frameworks such as React.

## 🚀 How to run the Projects?

To view each challenge in your browser:

1. Clone repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivanherreradev/frontendmentor-challenges.git

   ```

2. Go to the challenge folder and open the `index.html` in your browser or use Live Server in VSCode.

   ```bash
   cd challenge-name
   code .
   ```

   Or if the project requires Node.js:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
